How to install ZTinyMCE
=======================


Easy. Just extract these files into your Zope's Products folder on 
the filesystem then restart Zope.
Once you've restarted Zope, go to a suitable place in the Zope object
tree and create a ZTinyMCE object from the dropdown. It creates two 
example ZTinyMCE Configurations which you can familiarize yourself
with.


How to install language packs
=============================

Go to http://services.moxiecode.com/i18n/ and select the languages you
want to support. This will ask you to download a file called
tinymce_lang_pack.zip which you download and place inside the ZTinyMCE
directory (e.g. zope/Products/ZTinyMCE/). It's important that the
filename is exactly ``tinymce_lang_pack.zip`` since that's how it will
be discovered when you install it inside Zope.

Once you've restarted Zope and recreated all the files, a directory
called "langs" will appear in Zope.
