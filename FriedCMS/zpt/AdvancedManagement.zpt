<h3>Initialize Catalog</h3>
<p>By initializing the ZCatalog you make sure it has all the correct indexes and metadata. This
must have been done at least once before Update Catalog.</p>
<input type="submit" value="Initialize Catalog" />

</form>


<form action="UpdateCatalog" method="post">
<h3>Update Catalog</h3>
<p>It is good to update the catalog from time to time if you've made some manual changes such renaming
or moving documents around inside the management. On all other actions, the catalog gets automatically
updated. Doing this does not harm.</p>
<input type="submit" value="Update Catalog" />
