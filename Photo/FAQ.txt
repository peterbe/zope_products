Photo FAQ
---------

1) Will you add property 'xyz' to the default Photo properites?

   In short, no.  I purposefully left the properties to the minimum required
   id and title because everyone will want a different set of properties.
   I've gotten numerous requests for equally numerous different default
   properties.

   The Photo Folder object is designed to provide containing Photo objects
   with whatever default properties you want.  It works like this:

   1) Add a Photo Folder object.
   2) Go to the 'Photo Properties' tab and add the properties you want each
   photo to have.
   3) Go to the 'Displays' tab and add/remove/modify the display sizes you
   want each photo to have.
   4) When you add photos to this Photo Folder, each one will automatically
   get the specified properties and generate the specified display sizes.

2) How do I add a Photo Folder/Photo object from DTML/Python Script?

   See the source for all of the optional parameters, but here are the
   basics:

   Photo Folder:

     <dtml-call expr="manage_addProduct['Photo'].manage_addPhotoFolder(id, title)">

     context.manage_addProduct['Photo'].manage_addPhotoFolder(id, title)

   Photo:

     <dtml-call expr="manage_addProduct['Photo'].manage_addPhoto(id, title, file)">

     context.manage_addProduct['Photo'].manage_addPhoto(id, title, file)
