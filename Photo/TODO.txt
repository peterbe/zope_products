TODO, in no particular order:

  * Research extracting meta data from photos, such as date/time, exposure
    information, camera type, etc.
  * Add online Zope help.
  * Come up with some better icons, at least for Photo Folder.
  * Option for not resizing photos above their original size.
  * File system syncronization to keep Photo objects up to date with
    corresponding image files in the file system.
