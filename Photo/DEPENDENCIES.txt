* Photo was developed and tested with Zope 2.4.0.  It should work with
  the latest 2.3 version as well.

* Photo requires the PIL (Python Imaging Library) module available at
  http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/ or ImageMagick, available at
  http://www.imagemagick.org/ to render display sizes.  If you use
  ImageMagick on Windows, be sure the directory for ImageMagick
  is in your PATH before Windows, or Zope will try to use the convert.exe
  from Windows, not ImageMagick.

* To use the ExtImage store option, you must have ExtFile/Image installed
  and configured.
