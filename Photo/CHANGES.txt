* Release 1.2.3 (Stable) - Dec. 20, 2001

  - Fixed: bug preventing Add Photo form from displaying when
    adding a Photo outside of a Photo Folder.  Thanks to Timothy
    Wilson for reporting this.
    
  - Fixed: img tag alt attributes were not HTML quoted.  Thanks
    to Michael Bernstein for reporting this.
    
  - Changed: upgrading returns more useful information; the
    objects that were upgraded.
  
  - Fixed: Photo now supports the SYNC_ZODB option of ExtImage,
    where the image files are stored in subdirectories that
    correspond to the Zope path.  Each display is stored in a
    subdirectory named after the Photo object's id.  Thanks to
    Emmanuel Viennet for reporting the lack of support for this
    feature.

  - Fixed: ExtImage display files weren't removed (or marked with
    .undo) when they were purged or expired.
    
  - Fixed: New ExtImage files were created when updating the image
    data of an existing Photo.  This would leave stale files that
    were not tied to a Photo object.

* Release 1.2.2 (Stable) - Nov. 8, 2001

  - Removed: a script is no longer available for upgrading from
    the old Photo product.  Too many things are different.
  - Added: option to generate displays on-the-fly instead of
    when the photo is added.
  - Added: timeout (in minutes) for displays to remain generated.
    This is somewhat experimental, because of the unknown practical
    effects on how the ZODB will grow with these updates.
    When a display is viewed, if more than half of timeout
    has passed since the display's mod time, the mod time is
    updated to the current time and the other displays are flushed
    if their mod time's are greater than timeout.
    If timeout is 0, the displays are never removed.
  - Added: Purge All action in displays will remove all generated
    displays.  If any displays are "checked", they will not be
    removed and their mod times will be reset.
  - Added: Clean Up action in displays will remove all generated
    displays that have expired.  If any displays are "checked",
    they will not be removed and their mod times will be reset.
  - Changed: moved Upgrade.py to the Extensions directory so it
    no longer needs to be copied to do an upgrade.  Thanks to
    Robert Rottermann for the tip.

* Release 1.2.1 (Stable) - Oct. 26, 2001

  - Added: creating a display size of 0 width x 0 height
    will render a display with the same dimensions of the
    original photo, but will be processed by the engine.
    This is useful for storing high quality originals, but
    having a "same size" photo that has been compressed for
    faster viewing online.
  - Added: compression quality setting.  This is a number from
    1 (worst) to 100 (best) that is passed to the engine and
    determines the compression quality used for rendered displays.
    The default is 75.
  - Added: External Method for easier upgrading of all Photo and
    Photo Folder objects.  See UPGRADE.txt for details.
  - Added: FAQ.txt for FAQs

* Release 1.2.0 (Stable) - Oct. 19, 2001

  - Fixed: support for WebDAV and FTP only partially worked.
    It should now work with Zope 2.3.2+ and Zope 2.4+ to the
    extent that Zope itself supports WebDAV/FTP in these
    versions.
  - Changed: separated Photo settings from Photo properties
    to prevent name clashing with user-defined properties and
    in preparation of adding more settings to future versions.
    See UPGRADE.txt to update old Photo objects.
  - Changed: management interface modified to reflect separation
    of Photo settings vs. properties.
  - Fixed: new Photos uploaded via WebDAV/FTP were not acquiring
    the Photo Folder's settings/properties.
  - Changed: ImageMagick is now the default rendering engine
    instead of PIL.  Even though it is a fair amount slower,
    it produces much better images and is generally easier to
    install.

* Release 1.1.0 (Development) - Oct. 12, 2001

  - Added: support for WebDAV and FTP
  - Added: Image types uploaded to a Photo Folder are created
    as Photo objects instead of the default Zope Image object.

* Release 1.0.0 (Stable) - Oct. 12, 2001

  - Fixed: minor bug in tag() when display is not specified.
    Thanks Robert Rottermann.
      
* Release 0.9.2 (Development) - Sep. 2, 2001

  - Fixed: support for ImageMagick on Win32 was broken.
  - Fixed: PIL is no longer required, so silently ignore
    ImportError when it's not installed.
  - Fixed: typo in manage_addDisplay security declaration.

* Release 0.9.1 (Development) - Aug. 29, 2001

  - Fixed: editing properties in the Edit tab kills the
    original image.
  - Added: new method manage_regenDisplays makes it
    easier to regenerate all displays.

* Release 0.9.0 (Development) - Aug. 29, 2001

  - Added: support was added for ExtImage so that photo files
    can be stored in the file system instead of the ZODB.
  - Added: you can now use ImageMagick to render images as
    well as PIL.  ImageMagick rendering is done by running
    'convert' as a subprocess, not via a Python module, so
    this may or may not work for you.  IM is much slower, but
    produces smoother images.
  - Added: exttag() method returns an HTML img tag for
    serving the photos outside of Zope (eg, via Apache). Only
    useful with ExtImage storage.
  - Changed: Photo object is now a simple object, not a subclass
    of Image.  This allows for supporting ExtImage.  The original
    image is now stored as an attribute like all of the displays.
    See UPGRADE.txt for upgrading prior photos.
  - Added: default 'engine' property on Photo Folders gives
    new photo objects the default rendering engine (PIL or
    ImageMagick) on the add form.
  - Added: default 'store' property on Photo Folders gives
    new Photo objects the default storage (Image - ZODB, or
    ExtImage - File System) on the add form.
  - Added: a Regenerate All button in the displays tab
    will update all of the displays.  This is useful after
    you change the rendering engine.
  - Fixed: manage_editPhoto did not update photo, only properties.
  - Changed: cookie now defaults to 0 (off).  cookie=0 seemed to be
    used more often than cookie=1.

* Release 0.8.0 (Development) - Aug. 23, 2001

  - Initial public release.
