When I moved here from Sweden I decided to try my best to maintain the friendship I had with as many people as possible from back home. The best way to do that is probably to call each other and talk on the phone. Often. The second best way is most definitely to send each other emails every now and then to tell them what's happening in your life and asking them what happens in theirs. It doesn't have to be long emails but it's important to show to your distant friends that you're still thinking about them and by maintaining a connection there's a much greater chance of not loosing the friendship."

By spending my time on projects like this I can improve my skillset and try new concepts and solutions that I later apply under work conditions. The reason I ended up making a whole web application about keeping track of friends is because I wanted to test some new user experience features such as the password less security accounts and the email alerts in simple HTML."
