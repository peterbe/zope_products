<h2>I hate spam</h2>

<p>This website doesn't make any money and if it ever does it'll be 
from some advertisement on the webpages or possibly additional 
"gold features" for paying customers. I'm running this little project
as a sparetime fun project primarily because I needed the service for 
myself and also because I wanted to test some new web development techniques, 
for example, the passwordless login.</p>

<p><strong>If you're worried about entering your email address, don't be. I won't
send you any spam or other annoying offers from companies that I don't even
know. If you're worried about entering your a friends email address, don't be.</strong>
Those email address will <strong>never</strong> be used for anything except your
own benefit, which is that the reminders sent to you will make it easier to 
send the email to your friend.</p>

<p>If you're interested, check out this blog item I wrote about a 
solution to stop spam from happening: <a href="http://www.peterbe.com/Idea-A-new-anti-spam-law"
>it should be illegal to respond to spam</a>.</p>

<p>Now, take a deep breath and return to the <a href="/">home page</a> and let
this web application help start remembering your old friends.</p>
